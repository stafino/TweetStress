## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Week 2**
Selected the project and met with the supervisor on the 30th of September in Sir Arthur Williams Building. Initial meeting included the project description from both parties (what we're both expecting from it), receiving TicWatch Pro3. Me and Sharon decided that I will create a project proposal with the ILOs and find a middle ground on the project since we've both had different expectations for the project. 
* **Week 3**
On Friday 7th of October we've had a group meeting with Sharon, me and other people working on the projects under Sharon, which work also with stress related issues. In the meeting there was also a colleague of Sharon present - Sicheng Yin, who gave us a demo how to connect the TicWatch Pro3 to the computer and get relevant sensory data. 
* **Week 4**
Group meeting with the other project owners that have project under Sharon. Discussions about everyone's project and how are the projects connected to each other. Week 4 and Week 5 plan is to determine a model for the project, e.g. how to connect both the watch and the twitter with a mediator and how to store data in a secure manner. Initial idea is to create a mobile application that connects the two sides and stores the information securely. 
* **Week 5**
Still trying to figure out the issues from week 4. Try to connect the TicWatch Pro3 to the computer by the end of the week. Determine the project scope and finish the project proposal template in Notion. Organise the project structure within the repository, transfer all the minutes from Notion to the repository.
* **Week 6**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Week 7**
Research into relevant stress data that can be read from Watch. Additionally, create an architecture and a system design of the project.
* **Week 8**
Connect the Ticwatch Pro3 with the computer and use HRV Tracking repository on GitHub to filter out relevant, processed data. This leads to having relevant data from watch and display in a meaningful and organised way. Craft a system architecture for the product. 
* **Week 9**
Mediate connection between Watch and Twitter. Test GET/POST requests onto twitter with the Watch Data.
* **Week 10**
 Create a Detection Algorithm for the data retrieval, when it flags, what does it do with the data, etc.
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
 Create a Detection Algorithm for the data retrieval, when it flags, what does it do with the data, etc.
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
