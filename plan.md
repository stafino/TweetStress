## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Week 2**
Selected the project and met with the supervisor on the 30th of September in Sir Arthur Williams Building. Initial meeting included the project description from both parties (what we're both expecting from it), receiving TicWatch Pro3. Me and Sharon decided that I will create a project proposal with the ILOs and find a middle ground on the project since we've both had different expectations for the project. 
* **Week 3**
On Friday 7th of October we've had a group meeting with Sharon, me and other people working on the projects under Sharon, which work also with stress related issues. In the meeting there was also a colleague of Sharon present - Sicheng Yin, who gave us a demo how to connect the TicWatch Pro3 to the computer and get relevant sensory data. 
* **Week 4**
Group meeting with the other project owners that have project under Sharon. Discussions about everyone's project and how are the projects connected to each other. Week 4 and Week 5 plan is to determine a model for the project, e.g. how to connect both the watch and the twitter with a mediator and how to store data in a secure manner. Initial idea is to create a mobile application that connects the two sides and stores the information securely. 
* **Week 5**
Still trying to figure out the issues from week 4. Try to connect the TicWatch Pro3 to the computer by the end of the week. Determine the project scope and finish the project proposal template in Notion. Organise the project structure within the repository, transfer all the minutes from Notion to the repository.
* **Week 6**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Week 7**
Research into relevant stress data that can be read from Watch. Additionally, create an architecture and a system design of the project.
* **Week 8**
Connect the Ticwatch Pro3 with the computer and use HRV Tracking repository on GitHub to filter out relevant, processed data. This leads to having relevant data from watch and display in a meaningful and organised way. Craft a system architecture for the product. 
* **Week 9**
Mediate connection between Watch and Twitter. Test GET/POST requests onto twitter with the Watch Data.
* **Week 10**
 Create a Detection Algorithm for the data retrieval, when it flags, what does it do with the data, etc.
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
 Create a Detection Algorithm for the data retrieval, when it flags, what does it do with the data, etc.
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.

## Winter break

## Spring Semester

* **Week 13**
Conduct background research on stress management and social media. Develop a software development plan and timeline. Brainstorm design ideas for the mobile application.
* **Week 14**
Develop wireframes and prototypes for the mobile application. Begin coding the application in Flutter. Set up a Firebase account and start storing data.
* **Week 15**
Make sure all dependencies are up to date. Continue coding the application and integrate it with Firebase. Begin designing the user interface and user experience. Research the Twitter API and begin connecting the application to it.
* **Week 16**
Continue developing the mobile application and Twitter integration. Conduct a preliminary test of the application and make any necessary changes. Prepare for the first user study group.
* **Week 17**
Conduct the first user study group focusing on the best representation of stress levels on Twitter. Analyze the data collected from the user study group and make any necessary changes to the application.
* **Week 19**
Develop a second user study group focusing on ethical procedures and user emotions. Conduct the second user study group and collect data. Analyze the data and prepare for dissertation writing.
* **Week 20**
Begin writing the dissertation and organizing the data. Check the dissertation for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Identify any potential gaps in the research and address them.
* **Week 21**
Write the dissertation. Finalise project documentation and make sure everything is clear and understandable, e.g. how to run the project from GitHub, finalise notes from meetings, etc. Make sure everything is up to date with the highest standards. 
* **Week 22**
Transfer the dissertation to LaTeX and format it according to the required guidelines. Review the dissertation with the dissertation committee and address any concerns or questions. Prepare for the dissertation presentation.
* **Week 23 [TERM ENDS]**
Rehearse the dissertation presentation and prepare any necessary materials. Finalize the dissertation and make any last-minute changes. Submit the dissertation before the deadline.
* **Week 24** Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
Reflect on the whole process. Submit any final paperwork and complete any remaining requirements.
