* **Week 1**
----------------------------------------------------------------
* **Week 2**
Selected the project and met with the supervisor on the 30th of September in Sir Arthur Williams Building. Initial meeting included the project description from both parties (what we're both expecting from it), receiving TicWatch Pro3. Me and Sharon decided that I will create a project proposal with the ILOs and find a middle ground on the project since we've both had different expectations for the project. 
* **Week 3**
On Friday 7th of October we've had a group meeting with Sharon, me and other people working on the projects under Sharon, which work also with stress related issues. In the meeting there was also a colleague of Sharon present - Sicheng Yin, who gave us a demo how to connect the TicWatch Pro3 to the computer and get relevant sensory data.
