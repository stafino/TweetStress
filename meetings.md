## Week 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



## Week 2

### 30 Sep 2022
* Initial meeting with Sharon
* Received TicWatch Pro3, which will be used for the project
* Exchanged ideas about the project with Sharon - Sharon was thinking about implementing the data read from watch on social media, whilst my idea was to scrape twitter and look for keywords that strike a bell with the stress
* We decided to go with the visual representation as Sharon imagined
* I still need to finalise project proposal in order to have scope of the project defined well.



## Week 3

### 7 Oct 2022
* Meeting with Sharon, team and Sicheng Yin
* Discussed initial connection between TicWatch Pro3 and computer
* Sicheng showcased how to make the connection, providing us some information where to start
* We also received slides and github code for the connection
* Sharon also created a presentation to show us how the HRV works 
* Additionally, we discussed other variables connected with stress from the human body and how to measure them.



## Week 4

### 14 Oct 2022
* In some cases in detecting stress and mental illnesses it might be required to go through the official guideline and ethics checklist in order to “be in law” and not to violate their mental state
* I have to be careful if doing studies with sample sizes that you got all the consents that you have, even if the data is used anonymously 
* I need to find applications to see my own stress - e.g. ticsen, google fit 
* Need to brainstorm how to store data, communicate everything between WATCH - MY PROJECT - TWITTER. Data, such as login details for twitter. Maybe it is possible not saving it on my end but using the third party software to open a twitter login on a pop-up window, which would result in me not having to worry about the login details security.



## Week 5

### 21 Oct 2022
* Plan for next week is to connect Watch with developer mode to the computer --> using Android Studio
* Project proposal was very well done, still need to duplicate it and edit it accordingly (duplicate in order to not lose the original version, might be useful when writing the dissertation)
* Maybe if enough time, try to draft system architecture and other designs for app, connections, etc. If not enough time, this just gets postponed to the later weeks 
* Current stress application on TicWatch is not designed well, Bers will work on making a better designed one

# Week 7

### 4 Nov 2022 
* If booking a meeting room, e.g. for a research, potential customer meeting or a survey, make sure to do that a long time in advance. Most of the time the rooms are unavailable. If can't find the room, ask Sharon, she can provide her office or book a staff-only meeting room. 
* People experience stress in a foreign evnironment, which results in not expressing emotions 
* For some people leading a healthy lifestyle, cooking and exercising daily can be a cause for more stress rather than stress relieval, which it was supposed to be
* Some people presssure themselves, e.g. by having to get good results in every aspect of their life. Not always that comes from outside factors, such as parents, family and peers. 
* Sometimes, stress is not caused by the things that people HAVE TO DO (work, studying, university, etc.), however get stress by stuff they do not have to do but want to (extra curricular activities, friends, etc.).
* Majority of people struggle with time management, which leads to more stress
* Extensions on deadlines do not help most people (not only the ADHD ones), they end up finishing the assignments last second regardless. 
* HRV Github repository can be used to process the data in python. It should provide you with a .csv file containing filtered data, such as high frequency, low frequency, and other subparts of HRV. 
* High frequency HRV = high stress

## Week 9

### 29 Nov 2022
* During my meeting with my dissertation supervisor, we discussed the differences between a research paper and a dissertation. It was noted that a dissertation is easier to write and should be written first. The dissertation does not require original results crafted by the writer, whereas the paper requires relevant results conducted by the writer that have not been conducted before. We discussed the dissertation's abstract and conclusion, which should be written last. The structure of the dissertation was also discussed, which includes an abstract, introduction, related work, codesign workshop, technical infrastructure, prototype design, feedback on prototype, technical development, results, limitations, future possibilities, and conclusion. We talked about the challenge of working around API keys for Twitter for other users and Sharon's paper on video conferencing mockup. In the Codesign Workshop, we plan to create a design for the application, identify what stresses people out, find out how to protect privacy of participants, and design a stress data dashboard, among other things.

## Week 9

## 6 Mar 2023
* In the meeting with my dissertation supervisor, we discussed several important aspects related to stress sharing. We agreed to conduct interviews with friends to gather their perspectives on sharing stress levels and incorporate ambiguity in the study. We also plan to determine if friends noticed any stress-related posts and explore reactions to humorous gifs. To simulate automatic stress technology, we will observe expressions of care from others and investigate personal privacy concerns. We decided to emphasize automatic stress level detection and utilize emojis to enhance the survey. Additionally, we will observe reactions to stress levels of someone who experiences stress often and consider ethical considerations when asking about feelings. We will determine the appropriate frequency of data sharing and explore the motivation behind stress sharing. Finally, we plan to review the literature on stress sharing to further refine our study design.


## Week 10

## No meeting


## Week 11

## 17 Mar 2023

* During the meeting, we discussed several important points related to the stress sharing survey. First, we need to find a way to cite a podcast on Google. We decided to rename the survey to "Perceptions of Stress Sharing" and revise the data answers. We also agreed to move the data collection to a later time to capture more accurate responses. Additionally, we plan to include screenshots to clarify any questions and add open-ended questions for each Twitter prompt. We will assess how easy it is to interpret the data and test the survey questions with someone to ensure that they understand everything. We will also ask participants if they would be willing to use stress sharing technology if it were available and inquire about their personal experiences with stress sharing. Finally, we need to ensure that the survey message is clear and coherent and ask participants if they feel like they want to express care towards others. We will also inquire about privacy concerns and clarify which questions are directed towards the researcher and which ones are directed towards the user.
