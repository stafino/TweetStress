--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Week 2

### 30 Sep 2022
* Initial meeting with Sharon
* Received TicWatch Pro3, which will be used for the project
* Exchanged ideas about the project with Sharon - Sharon was thinking about implementing the data read from watch on social media, whilst my idea was to scrape twitter and look for keywords that strike a bell with the stress
* We decided to go with the visual representation as Sharon imagined
* I still need to finalise project proposal in order to have scope of the project defined well.

* We also received slides and github code for the connection
* Sharon also created a presentation to show us how the HRV works 
* Additionally, we discussed other variables connected with stress from the human body and how to measure them.


## Week 4

### 14 Oct 2022
* In some cases in detecting stress and mental illnesses it might be required to go through the official guideline and ethics checklist in order to “be in law” and not to violate their mental state
* I have to be careful if doing studies with sample sizes that you got all the consents that you have, even if the data is used anonymously 
* I need to find applications to see my own stress - e.g. ticsen, google fit 
* Need to brainstorm how to store data, communicate everything between WATCH - MY PROJECT - TWITTER. Data, such as login details for twitter. Maybe it is possible not saving it on my end but using the third party software to open a twitter login on a pop-up window, which would result in me not having to worry about the login details security.
